# LC3 VM in Rust

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of an LC3 (Little Computer 3) Emulator in Rust, providing a platform for simulating LC3 assembly language programs.

## Usage

Use this command to run an program path:

```rust
cargo run <path-to-assembly-file>
```
Replace \<path-to-assembly-file\> with the path to a file containing LC3 assembly code to execute. Try with the example programs placed in [/examples](/examples).
